# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Requirements
Before installing, [download and install Golang](https://golang.org/dl/). go1.15.8 or higher is required.

## Installation

Congratulations.

You can now access to all GET routes like list article(s), get comments, etc.
Now get to 127.0.0.1/signup to create an account. 
Then go to 127.0.0.1/signin to enter your credentials and get your bearer token (present in the header of the response under "Authorisation").
You can now access to all the POST routes during 20 minutes (create article, update article, create comment, etc) by adding the token in your header, until it expires.
